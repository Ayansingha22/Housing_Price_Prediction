# Housing_Price_Prediction

Housing Price Prediction is a machine learning technique to predict the price of houses or real estates based on previous data. 

The price is predicted after the model (in this case XGBoost Regressor model) is trained using the concept of Supervised learning.

The training data will have all the factors(inputs) driving the price and also the price(output). Then the model will be able to predict the prices of any dataset containing the inputs.
